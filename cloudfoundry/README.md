# Configuring the Blue Medora Firehose Nozzle
The Blue Medora Firehose Nozzle is a Cloud Foundry component that collects metrics from the Loggregator Firehose  and exposes them via a RESTful API. Before the nozzle can be configured, it must be deployed.

There are multiple ways to deploy the nozzle:

- Installing the nozzle via the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf-cli)
- Cloning the nozzle from the github repo and running it on any box that can connect to the Traffic Controller
- Installing the nozzle via the BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Prerequisites CF App method**

- Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf-cli) available at: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli
- To deploy the nozzle, configure manifest.yml and run cf push to install the cf app as described  here: https://github.com/BlueMedora/bluemedora-firehose-nozzle#deploying-as-cf-app

**Cloning Deployment Method**

- Install the Go programming language (version 1.6+) on a box that can connect to the Traffic Controller
- To deploy the nozzle, run the following command, which clones the nozzle files and dependencies from the github repository and sets them up them in your Go environment:
```
go get github.com/BlueMedora/bluemedora-firehose-nozzle
```

**BOSH CLI Deployment Method**

- Install the BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI) using the BOSH release available at: https://github.com/BlueMedora/bluemedora-firehose-nozzle-release
- Deploy the nozzle as instructed in the following tutorial: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/nozzle-tutorial.html

**Procedure**
The following sections describe how to configure the nozzle once it has been deployed using one of the  methods mentioned above. For additional support, refer to the following reference material:

- For information on managing UAA users within Cloud Foundry, refer to the following guide: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/uaa-user-management.html
- For more information on setting up a nozzle user with BOSH, refer to the following tutorial: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/nozzle-tutorial.html
- For more information on setting up the BOSH manifest, refer to the following guide: https://bosh.io/docs/deployment-manifest.html
NOTE: For more information on how metrics are pulled from the Blue Medora Firehose Nozzle, refer to section 
“Webserver”.

**Configuring the UAA User**
Ensure the Cloud Foundry UAA user you plan to use is authorized to access the loggregator firehose and has doppler.firehose permissions. An example of one way to modify the UAA user involves editing your Cloud Foundry BOSH manifest under the properties.uaa.clients section.

An example configuration would look similar to the following:
```
properties:
    uaa:
        clients:
            bluemedora-firehose-nozzle:
                access-token-validity: 1209600
                authorized-grant-types: authorization_code,client_credentials,refresh_token
                override: true
                secret: <password>
                scope: openid,oauth.approvals,doppler.firehose
                authorities: oauth.login,doppler.firehose
```

**Configuring the Nozzle**
To configure the nozzle itself, which connects to the Cloud Foundry firehose and exposes a RESTful API, modify and re-save the configuration file, bluemedora-firehose-nozzle.json, located in the config folder of the nozzle files as follows:

**Blue Medora Firehose Nozzle Configuration Fields**

| Field Name | Description |

## Installing the Plugin

We recommend using the New Relic Platform Installer for installing and running your Blue Medora plugins for New Relic.

The New Relic Platform Installer (NPI) is a command line tool that helps you easily download, configure, and manage New Relic Platform Plugins.  For more information, refer to the [Installing an NPI-compatible plugin documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/plugins/plugins-new-relic/installing-plugins/installing-npi-compatible-plugin).

Once the NPI tool has been installed, run the following command:

```
    ./npi install com.bluemedora.cloudfoundry
``` 

**Note:** This command will take care of the creation of `newrelic.json` and `plugin.json` files described in the [Configuring the Plugin](#Configuring-the-Plugin) section.

###### [Download Plugin for Manual Installation](https://newrelic-bluemedora.s3.amazonaws.com/com-bluemedora-cloudfoundry/newrelic_cloudfoundry_plugin-2.0.0_20170417_145033.tar.gz)

----
    
## Configuring the Plugin
From the extracted plugin folder you receive when downloading your plugin, you will find the following files: 

```
  plugin.jar
  eula.txt
  oss_attribution.txt
  [config folder]
    newrelic.template.json
    plugin.template.json 
    plugin_license.json
```

The "template" .json files found in the config folder must be modified (i.e., customized) and renamed prior to setting up the plugin for monitoring.

### Configuring the `newrelic.template.json` file

The first file, `newrelic.template.json`, contains configurations used by all Platform plugins (e.g., license key, logging information, proxy settings) and can be shared across your plugins.
Make a copy of this template and rename it to `newrelic.json`. Listed below are the configurable fields within the newrelic.json file:

**New Relic License Key** - The only required field in the `newrelic.json` file is the License Key. This unique identifier informs New Relic about the specific account tied to the plugin. For more information on the License Key, [refer to the New Relic License key documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key).

**Example:**

```
{
   “license_key”: “YOUR LICENSE KEY”
}
```

**Insights Configuration** - Blue Medora plugins support reporting events to New Relic Insights. 
In order to achieve this you need to supply your `insights_api_key` and `insights_account_id`. 
You can find these fields in on [your New Relic API Keys page](https://rpm.newrelic.com/apikeys). 
For more information, [refer to the New Relic Insights documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/insert-custom-events-insights-api#register).

Below are the fields needed to configure Insights access.

`insights_api_key` - The api key associated with your Insights account.

`insights_account_id` - The ID associated with your Insights account.

`insights_use_ssl` - Signals whether to connect to Insights via SSL. Acceptable values are `true` or `false`.

**Example:**

```
{
    "license_key": "YOUR LICENSE KEY",
    "insights_api_key": "YOUR INSIGHTS API KEY",
    "insights_account_id": "YOUR INSIGHTS ACCOUNT ID",
    "insights_use_ssl": true
}
```

**Logging Configuration** - By default Platform plugins will have their logging turned on; however, you can modify these settings with the following configurations:

`log_level` - The log level. Valid values: [debug, info, warn, error, fatal]. Defaults to info.

`log_file_name` - The log file name. Defaults to newrelic_plugin.log.

`log_file_path` - The log file path. Defaults to logs.

`log_limit_in_kbytes` - The log file limit in kilobytes. Defaults to 25600 (25 MB). If limit is set to 0, the log file size would not be limited.

**Example:**

```
{
    "license_key": "YOUR LICENSE KEY",
    "log_level": "info",
    "log_file_name": "newrelic_plugin.log",
    "log_file_path": "logs",
}
```

**Proxy Configuration** - If you are running your plugin from a machine that runs outbound traffic through a proxy, you can use the following optional configurations in your `newrelic.json` file:

`proxy_host` - The proxy host (e.g. webcache.example.com)

`proxy_port` - The proxy port (e.g. 8080). Defaults to 80 if a proxy_host is set

`proxy_username` - The proxy username

`proxy_password` - The proxy password

**Example:**

```
{
  "license_key": "YOUR LICENSE KEY",
  "proxy_host": "proxy.mycompany.com",
  "proxy_port": 9000
}
```

### Configuring the `plugin.template.json` file: 

The second file, `plugin.template.json`, contains data specific to each plugin (e.g., a list of hosts and port combinations for what you are monitoring). Templates for both of these files should be located in the ‘config’ directory in your extracted plugin folder.

Make a copy of this template and rename it to `plugin.json`. Shown below is an example of the `plugin.json` file’s contents.


**NOTE:** Each object in the "agents" array should have a unique "instance_name".

**Fields**

| Field Name | Description |
|:------------- |:-------------|
| polling_interval_seconds | The number of seconds between each data collection. |
| instance_name | The name of your New Relic Cloud Foundry instance that will appear in the user interface |
| username | User name to log into the Blue Medora Nozzle |
| password | Password to log into the Blue Medora Nozzle |
| host | The hostname or ip address of the Blue Medora Nozzle |
| validate_certificate_against_truststore | whether or not to Validate The Certificate Against the Trust Store, `true` or `false`. |
| port | Optional parameter, port to connect to. Defaults to `443` if not present |
| send_to_plugin | Indicates whether or not to send data to New Relic Plugins. See [Blue Medora's New Relic Knobs and Levers Readme](https://github.com/BlueMedora/new-relic-plugins/blob/master/configuration-variants/readme.md) for more details |
| send_to_insights | Indicates whether or not to send data to New Relic Insights. See [Blue Medora's New Relic Knobs and Levers Readme](https://github.com/BlueMedora/new-relic-plugins/blob/master/configuration-variants/readme.md) for more details |

## Using the Plugin
For more information about navigating New Relic’s user interface, refer to their [Using a plugin documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/plugins/plugins-new-relic/using-plugins/using-plugin) section.

## Troubleshooting/Known Issues
#### java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

When running a plugin, a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` may occur if too much data is being processed for the system to handle. If that issues arises, you will need to modify the `java_args` field of the “master” `newrelic.json` file located in the npi base `config` directory.

`java_args` - `-Xmx128m` (-Xmxn specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory allocation pool. This value must a multiple of 1024 greater than 2 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration.)

- **Examples:**

- `-Xmx83886080`

- `-Xmx81920k`

- `-Xmx80m`



#### FATAL ERROR: JS Allocation failed - process out of memory

If you see `FATAL ERROR: JS Allocation failed - process out of memory` during installation, edit newrelic-npi/npi replacing `bin/node npi.js "$@"` with `bin/node --max-old-space-size=4096 npi.js "$@" #modified for 4gb memory`
